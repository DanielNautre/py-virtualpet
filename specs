Key values to keep in mind:

Age: as time passes, you pet ages.
Hunger: when this hits 0, your pet will start loosing health
Health: When this hits 0, your pet will die
Joy: the happier your pet is, the more something something
Love: the higher the value, the more your pet will love you (and stuff might happen)
